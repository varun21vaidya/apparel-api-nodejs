# Apparel API

This repository contains a REST API for managing apparel inventory and orders for a vendor. The API is implemented using Node.js in TypeScript.

## Business Knowledge

- A vendor can manage stock quality and prices for different apparel items.
- Each piece of apparel has a unique code and can come in multiple sizes.
- Users can check stock availability and pricing for specific apparel items and sizes.
- Users can place orders for multiple apparel items and sizes.

## Technical Design

- Data is stored in a local JSON file to persist between server restarts.
- TypeScript is used for type safety and better code organization.
- The API endpoints are designed to fulfill the business requirements mentioned above.
- Unit tests are included to ensure the reliability of the API.
